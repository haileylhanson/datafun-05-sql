# üü† Part 1: Project Initialization

This section provides step-by-step instructions to initialize a new Python project. 
These tasks include starting a project from scratch or using an existing template, setting up the project files, and creating a project virtual environment for development.

**IMPORTANT**: Complete all of Part 1 first: [üü¢ Set up the Machine](../01-machine-setup/MACHINE-SETUP.md)

---

## Steps for Project Initialization

1. EITHER Copy an Existing Project OR Create a New One From Scratch. Choose 1:
   - [01a-copy-existing-repo-in-github.md](01a-copy-existing-repo-in-github.md)  
   - [01b-create-repo-in-github.md](01b-create-repo-in-github.md)

2. ALWAYS Use Git to **clone** the new repository to your local machine:  
   - [02-clone-repo-to-local.md](02-clone-repo-to-local.md)

3. *IF starting from scratch only*: Add key files such as `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt` (or `project.toml` if following advanced Option B):  
   - [03-add-gitignore-and-requirements.md](03-add-gitignore-and-requirements.md)

4. *IF starting from scratch only*: Use Git to add, commit, and push your new files to GitHub:  
   - [04-git-add-commit-push.md](04-git-add-commit-push.md)

5. ALWAYS **Create a Python Virtual Environment** for your project:  
   - [05-create-virtual-environment.md](05-create-virtual-environment.md)

## Important

- Initialize your project correctly to avoid issues later.
- Follow the steps carefully and in order.
- For projects that use templates or examples, review the project first and understand the starting structure.

## Pronounce Key Files and Folders Correctly

- When you see `.gitignore`, say "Dot Git Ignore" file.
- When you see `README.md`, say "READ ME Dot M D" file.
- When you see `requirements.txt`, say "Requirements Dot T X T" file.
- When you see `.venv`, say "Dot V E N V" folder.

NOTE: The auto-generated audio guide gets these correct some of the time, but not all. 
For best results, view the written guide and commands while listening.

# üîµ Part 2: Repeatable Project Workflow

This section provides step-by-step instructions for working on an existing Python project. 
These steps are repeatable and should be followed whenever you make changes, update dependencies, or work on project features.

**IMPORTANT**: Complete all of Part 1: [üü¢ Set up the Machine](../01-machine-setup/MACHINE-SETUP.md) and Part 2: [üü† Initialize a Project](../02-project-initialization/PROJECT-INITIALIZATION.md) first, before continuing.

## When Working on The Project

Follow these steps when starting a new work session on a professional Python project.

1. **Pull** the Latest Changes from GitHub. 
   - [01-git-pull-before-changes.md](01-git-pull-before-changes.md)

2. **Activate** the Project Virtual Environment:
   - [02-activate-virtual-environment.md](02-activate-virtual-environment.md)

3. **Install** Dependencies As Needed:
   - [03-install-dependencies.md](03-install-dependencies.md)

4. **Run** Scripts and/or Jupyter notebooks. Choose one or both as needed:  
   - [04a-activate-and-run-python-script.md](04a-activate-and-run-python-script.md)  
   - [04b-activate-and-run-jupyter-notebook.md](04b-activate-and-run-jupyter-notebook.md)

5. **Modify** code and test functionality:
   - [05-modify-and-test.md](05-test-and-make-changes.md)

6. **Save** your work with git add-commit-push to GitHub: 
   - [06-git-add-commit-push.md](06-git-add-commit-push.md)


## Important

- Always pull the latest changes before starting to avoid merge conflicts.
- Test your project to ensure it works as expected before using git add-commit-push.
- Make frequent commits when enhancing a project.
